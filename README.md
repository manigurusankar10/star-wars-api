# Star wars Api

Simple app that calls a [star wars api](https://swapi-node.vercel.app/).

The goal of this app is to learn how to use `useInfiniteQuery` of `react-query`.
[React-infinite-scroller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroller) was used to create a simple infinite scrolling element,
which gets populated by the results from the api.
